# Hi :wave:, I'm Christopher Horrell

I'm a Canadian currently living in Toronto, grew up in Scarborough.

I'm a DevOps Engineer with long career in the web hosting and cloud computing space dating back to 2004. My current focus, after a brief stint as a Site Reliability Engineer, is Build and Release engineering. I love working on and building things that help people build things and the Build and Release space is where I've had the most career satisfaction. I also love open source and my work (and modest contributions) in that area has been the most rewarding professionally and personally.
